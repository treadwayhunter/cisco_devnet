# Meraki Practice
### Meraki Dashboard
The Meraki Dashboard appears to be extremely intuitive to use.
I launched the reserved sandbox, and I was able to quickly create a new admin account using my own email. Even better, I don't need to use a VPN to do any of this like I do other networks, since all of this stuff is hosted in the cloud.

### API Key
Technically, it's bad to have the api key stored plainly, but this is only for practice. I can use this API key to make requests to the Meraki API.
