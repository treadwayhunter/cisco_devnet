## What I learned recently

### Mar 16, 2025
    * python ncclient
    * python pygnmi (gRPC network management interface)
    * ansible
    * netconf is meant to be stateful and transactional
    * restconf is stateless
    * gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is better than both, and is great for telemetry
